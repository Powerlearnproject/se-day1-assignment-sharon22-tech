#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It's crucial in the technology industry as it ensures software products are reliable, efficient, and meet customer needs.
Traditional progrmming focuses on writing code, software engineering encompasses a holistic approach to creatinga robust, scalable, and user friendly software systems.For example, building a mobile app; a software developer would write code for a specific feature line like the login screen while an engineer would design the overall app, achitecture, plan the database structure, and ensure app meets user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1950s: The term "software engineering" was coined, recognizing software development as a distinct field.
2. 1970s: The Waterfall methodology emerged, introducing a linear approach to software development.
3. 2001: The Agile Manifesto was published, emphasizing iterative and flexible development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.**Planning** - Requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and prioritized from clients and stakeholders.
2.**Design**- A detailed plan is created by the team for the software. This includes achitectural design, user interface design and database design. 
3.**Development**- Developers write code based on the design specifications following coding standards and practices.
4.**Testing**- The software undergoes testing to identify defects, validate functionality and ensure it meets quality standards.Various testing types e.g unit testing are perfomed.
5.**Deployment and Maintenance**- Once software passes testing, its deployed to production enviroments. Maintenance involves ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates throughout its lifecycle.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Waterfall** is a traditional, linear project managment approach.It follows a sequencial process with well defined stages, where each stage must be completed before moving on to the next.
It is used with large, complex projects with specific, unchanging requirements. While **Agile** model emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and iterative progress.It breaks down work into short time-based cycles called sprits(usually one to four week).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. **Software Developer**: Designs, develops, and tests software
2. **Quality Assurance** Engineer: Ensures software meets quality standards
3. **Project Manager**: Oversees project planning, execution, and delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing (e.g., Eclipse, Visual Studio)

VCS (Version Control Systems): Manage code changes and collaborations (e.g., Git, SVN)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
**The following case study is a great example is showcasing challenges faced by software engineers and how they overcame them.**
Case Study:

Company: NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)

Project: Mars Curiosity Rover

Challenge:

In 2012, the Mars Curiosity Rover's software team faced a critical challenge. The rover's flash memory, which stored critical flight software, was experiencing errors due to radiation exposure in space. This caused the rover to reboot repeatedly, putting the entire mission at risk.

Challenges faced by software engineers:

1. Limited resources: The team had to work with limited computing resources, bandwidth, and memory.
2. Radiation-induced errors: The team had to mitigate the effects of radiation on the rover's electronics.
3. Remote debugging: The team had to debug issues from millions of miles away, without direct access to the rover.

How they overcame the challenge:

1. Redundancy: The team implemented redundant systems to ensure critical functions remained operational.
2. Error correction: They developed algorithms to detect and correct errors caused by radiation.
3. Remote patching: The team created a patch to update the rover's software remotely, without requiring a physical reboot.
4. Collaboration: The team worked closely with hardware engineers to understand the radiation effects and develop mitigations.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

**Unit-testing**: This testing level, individual parts of software or products are tested. The idea of this is to confirm every part or unit of the product after the test.
 
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective input prompts to interact with AI models.

**Importance of Prompt Engineering**:

1. Improved Accuracy: Well-designed prompts help AI models understand the context and intent, leading to more accurate responses.
2. Increased Efficiency: Effective prompts reduce the need for multiple follow-up questions, saving time and resources.
3. Enhanced User Experience: Clear and concise prompts facilitate a smoother interaction between humans and AI systems.
4. Better Decision-Making: High-quality prompts provide more informative responses, enabling better decision-making.
5. Reducing Bias: Carefully crafted prompts can help mitigate bias in AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example:

Vague prompt: "Write a story"

Improved prompt: "Write a science fiction story set in a futuristic city with a strong female protagonist"

The improved prompt is more effective as it provides clear guidance for the AI model.
